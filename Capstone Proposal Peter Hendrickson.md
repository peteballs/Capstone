Capstone Proposal

The Liberator Fund is a simulated quantitative investment hedge fund that allows investors (users) to login to access their account data to include initial investment returns,etc. with graphical representation (tableau) of recent and historical performance, etc. The site will facilitate the integration of Metatrader 4 (MT4) and Python through the ZeroMQ interface, which allows expert robot advisors to execute coded MT4 strategies and further develop optimization to currently employed investment strategies with Python in live trading. This includes a machine learning capacity to further refine current investment strategies as market conditions change. 

The site will facilitate a live trading strategy tester and optimization feature that will facilitate historical analysis of the best overall investment strategies currently employed by The Liberator Fund. Users will be able to access these features to forecast actual investment strategies with their potential returns based on past performance of the firm’s investment strategy in the foreign currency exchange market. The strategy incorporates seven market driven strategies that are triggered based on particular market conditions, which are identified using Classes in Python and executed with MT4 live expert robot advisors as quantitative factors are triggered. 

The overall investment strategies employed by The Liberator Fund are developed using quantitative models that are based on technical market analysis with the exception of pertinent macro-economic data. The integration of Python can be accomplished with MT4 strategies that have already been developed and coded for MT4 by the developer (Peter Hendrickson). There will be an ongoing feature for MT4 using Python to ensure that further refinements are integrated into the code utilizing optimization features that are included in the MT4 / ZeroMQ / Python interface. The investment strategy code employed by expert robot advisors will be encrypted to further protect both user information and the overall strategies employed.

The entire process will allow users to assess the historical relevance of the strategies employed by The Liberator Fund as well as evaluate the user’s recent account performance. This will be accomplished through the MT4 built-in strategy tester with graphical representation of performance to include percentage of wins, maximum drawdown, maximum loss, expected returns, and profit analysis per trade. The overall site facilitates a more robust optimum evaluation of potential performance for users. 

Project Overview

The project will promote more transparency than is typically experienced in the marketplace for investors by facilitating strategy testers and graphical representation of the results from a historical perspective. The protected user access feature promotes security of their account information; however, it facilitates their involvement throughout the entire process. This will allow investors to fully understand the potential returns and reduce concerns over how the fund is managed. This is a level of sophistication that supersedes the current marketplace. 

Functionality
The initial page will be a visually pleasing page that promotes The Liberator Fund’s purpose in an attempt to gain additional clients and answer questions for potential clients regarding the Liberator Fund’s overall strategy and the principals of the firm, etc. The specific objectives of the Fund will be included in significant detail on the next few pages. The User Login page with limited information as this site is directed to Users and will incorporate the overall fund features previously discussed to include strategy testers and account information. The primary feature will be the integration of MT4, ZeroMQ, and Python in terms of functionality. Overall, the site will achieve both a marketing objective and a strong User account information aspect to the site. 

Data Model
The data that will be stored includes historical price data for the foreign currency exchange market that is readily available from MT4 through the broker, Oanda. The ZeroMQ interface facilities the transfer of this historical data, which will be utilized to execute live quantitative trading strategies through robot expert advisors. The execution and investment strategy will be consistently optimized based on algorithms that will consistently aim to further refine currently employed strategies. User data and The Liberator Fund’s historical results will also need to stored.
